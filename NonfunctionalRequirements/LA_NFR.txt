REQ-ID: LA_NFR
Description: The product will record a history of previous customers assigned to a ticket. 
Type: Security
Rationale: This is for traceability and auditing purposes. For example, in the case of a dispute about a returned ticket, an administrator can see which customer the ticket was previously assigned to. 
Fit Criterion: An unsold ticket will 0 customer IDs in its history. A sold ticket and a returned ticket will have at least 1 customer ID’s in its history. A reallocated ticket will have at least 2 customer IDs in its history.

Comments: [LA] Added non functional requirement associated with the functional requirement REQ_LA_01. 
Comments: [JA] Recording an audit trail in this way will certainly be valuable. However, the fit criterion as stated seems to assume a specific way ticketing will be implementated (as single tickets, remaining valid, which are passed from user to user). There are various ways the tickets might be sold: to individuals/organisations, with special requirements, etc - these might change upon each sale/resale, and in fact tickets may not be directly "recycled" as described. Instead, I would suggest that the fit criterion be changed to something approximating - "tickets cannot be sold, returned, or re-bought without a corresponding entry in the audit log".
Comments: [MW] Perhaps use the specified purposes in the rationale - traceability and auditing. Define a measure linking events to the record of the events for traceability and define the outcome of an audit (I'm not an expert on auditing - I guess there are some standard audit methods that could be applied).
