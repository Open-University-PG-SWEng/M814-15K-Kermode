Comment: [RT] Adding suggested change request to fit criterion: This is well structured, however the FIT criteria does not make it clear if the reason would be pre-defined or not.  If not, then 5/10 second windows may be difficult for users with poor keyboard skills or other accessibility issues.
Comment: [DW] Adding review response: Fit criterion appears to be complete and appropriate. In response to the previous review comment: I believe that this fit criterion will drive the design solution. To meet these constraints the designers will probably choose to implement a pre-defined list, but it is up to the designers how they choose to meet the requirement.
Comment: [MWC] I tend to agree with RT: the fit criterion should include a defined list or "other" and should be worded so that the customer does not have any ambiguous choices – where some choices may have different connotations in different languages and a good proportion of Commonwealth countries do not have English as a first language (and a good proportion of AU residents are from SE Asia).
