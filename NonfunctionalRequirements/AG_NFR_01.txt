Comments      : [AG] Added NFR associated with FR_002
Comments      : [HD] While it is a good idea  the standard quoted is not appropriate to the product as it only applies to European Comission information systems; the product is under Australian juristriction. It may be better to reference ISO27001 which has as control objectives a requirement to have an access control policy.
