REQ-ID: NFR-REQ-PB-02
Description: The product shall be able to issue the Customer Confirmation of their ticket(s) return at any time
Type: NFR-Operational
Rationale: So that the Customer does not have to wait an excessive amount of time for their return(s) confirmation
Fit Criterion: A Confirmation of Ticket(s) returns shall be issued immediately following receipt of Refund Status from the Payment System which may also occur at any time of day/day of year
Originator: Patrick Burns
[JK] Added review response: ideally a confirmation of ticket(s) return should be sent immediately, but due to load on both the servers or the network there is a possibility that the customer will not receive it that quickly and I think it is this that should be tested.  I would suggest detailing customer percentages, (e.g. 90% of customers), and stating a time period during which they should receive the confirmation, (e.g. 15 seconds).
Comment: [MJW] I agree with JK. 'Immediately' is not defined, maybe within 1 second or other given time frame.
Comment: [MWC] I like this NFR.  I would suggest extending the fit criteria to include the ability to print confirmation from the ‘returns’ screen, as well as receive a confirmatory e-mail, which would fit (pun intended) with “immediately” in the criterion, plus include a unique reference ID for later queries ("where's my refund").
