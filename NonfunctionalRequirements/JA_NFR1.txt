REQ-ID: JA_NFR1
Description: The product shall only display details of previously purchased tickets to authorized users
Type: Security
Rationale: To maintain privacy of previously entered information, such as event attendance, seat allocation, or special requirements, this information should only be displayed to the originating user (individual or organistation) determined by authentication.
Fit Criterion: The system will not make any details of tickets previously purchased available to any user that did not purchase them. This will be ensured by product security of specification meeting or exceeding the ISO/IEC 27001:2013 standard.

Comments: [JA] Added security requirement JA_NFR1 applying to functional requirement REQ-JA-02
Comment: [RT] Adding suggested change request to fit criterion: This is good, however it may be useful to specify exactly which part(s) of the ISO standard relate to this requirement.  The ISO standard itself is very broad and detailed, therefore it may be hard for those unfamiliar with all of it to correctly ascertain if the requirement has been met or not.


Comment: {PRD] Adding suggested change request to fit criterion: I think it could be mentioned that end to end encyption shall be applied (SSH for example) and mention an encryption standard.
Comment: [HD] Given the rationale relates to privacy it may be worth considering including compliance with Australian Data protection regulations within the fit criterion. Privacy Act 1988 and Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2000 (C'th) are the likely applicable legislation.
