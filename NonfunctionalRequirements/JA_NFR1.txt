REQ-ID: JA_NFR1
Description: The product shall only display details of previously purchased tickets to authorized users
Type: Security

Fit Criterion: The system will not make any details of tickets previously purchased available to any user that did not purchase them. This will be ensured by product security of specification meeting or exceeding the ISO/IEC 27001:2013 standard.
