Comment: [Sam S] Adding my non functional requirment
REQ-ID: UHR_SS_01
Description: the product shall be usable by spectators where their first language is not English.
Type: 11b (Usability and Humanity Requirement, Personalization and Internationalization)
Rational: The event is a global event.  The spectators are from different countries, speaking different language.  
Fit Criterion: 70% of people whose first language is not English, and do not need assistance when using a system in their first language 90% of the time, can use the product to purchase a ticket without assistant.
Originator:Leslie Patterson mentions Commonwealth countries will want tickets. 
Comments: [HD] The fit criterion as written is confusing.  I believe you are trying to convey that no assiatance is required 90% of the time when using the system in the native language for 70% of users.
Comment: [MWC] More of a question really - I would assume that the development team would localise the application accoding to the location of the user, so the language issue is more of a solution than a requirement?
Comment: [AG] The fit criterion is not easy to read. Suggest something like "Less than 10% of the users of the non-English versions of the site ask for assistance".
Comment: [MM] Admittedly I have difficulties in understanding your fit criterion. It is not clear if the site is translated into various languages or if the english version should be meeting your criterion

Comment: [Sam] Three comments are related to confusion and suggested rewordings, which I agree and mainly with [HD]’s comment.  I feel [MCW], [MM] and [AG]’s comment suggest assumed solutions to the users’ web browsers according to where the users were located or how ‘Internationalization’ was managed.  Both elements are irrelevant to the function requirement.  I am assuming there is similar non-function requirement that maps this process but for users whose first language matches the language set for JustTheTicket.  In which case, I would like to see a similar measurable scale.
Comment: [Sam] As per suggestions I will change my fit criterion to:
Comment: [Sam] 90% of people using the product for the first time and their first language is not English should be able to return a ticket at the same success rate of 75%, as thou they were using the same product for the first time in their native language.
