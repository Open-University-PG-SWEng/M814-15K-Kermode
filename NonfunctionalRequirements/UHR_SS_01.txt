Comment: [Sam S] Adding my non functional requirment
REQ-ID: UHR_SS_01
Description: the product shall be usable by spectators where their first language is not English.
Type: 11b (Usability and Humanity Requirement, Personalization and Internationalization)
Rational: The event is a global event.  The spectators are from different countries, speaking different language.  
Fit Criterion: 70% of people whose first language is not English, and do not need assistance when using a system in their first language 90% of the time, can use the product to purchase a ticket without assistant.
Originator:Leslie Patterson mentions Commonwealth countries will want tickets. 
Comments: [HD] The fit criterion as written is confusing.  I believe you are trying to convey that no assiatance is required 90% of the time when using the system in the native language for 70% of users.
