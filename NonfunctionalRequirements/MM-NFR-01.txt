REQ-ID:MM-NFR-01
Description: The product shall only allow a ticket to be returned for a future event
Type: Usability and Humanity
Rationale: The process of returning tickets will take some time to complete, which is why events lying in the future at the beginning of the use case may lie in the past (or beyond sales closing time) at the end of the use case. The ensuing error message causes inconvenience for the customer and potentially bad reputation for the committee
Fit Criterion: 95 % of users unfamiliar with the system shall be able to complete the return process within 60 seconds
