REQ-ID:MM-NFR-01
Description: The product shall only allow a ticket to be returned for a future event
Type: Usability and Humanity
Rationale: The process of returning tickets will take some time to complete, which is why events lying in the future at the beginning of the return process might lie in the past (or beyond sales closing time) at the end of the process. The ensuing error message causes at least inconvenience for the customer and potentially bad reputation for the operator
Fit Criterion: 95 % of users unfamiliar with the system and/or computers shall be able to complete the return process within 60 seconds
Originator: Markus Meyerhofer
Comment: [Markus M] NFR based on REQ_LA_02 added
Comment: [Sam] Adding suggested change request to fit criterion: Good. However, I want to know: what does unfamiliar mean? What makes a user unfamiliar? If I have seen the system for 10 seconds, does that make me familiar?
