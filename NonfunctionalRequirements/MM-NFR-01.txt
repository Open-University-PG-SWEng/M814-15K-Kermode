REQ-ID:MM-NFR-01
Description: The product shall only allow a ticket to be returned for a future event
Type: Performance (Accuracy)
Rationale: Customers from around the world may use the system, therefore an accurate, error-free calculation of time, in particular handling of time zone differences, is crucial. Additionally, a certain amount of latency in using the system will occur for technical reasons.
Fit Criterion: The date & time (in UTC) a ticket is returned must lie at least 2 seconds before the sales closing date & time (in UTC).
