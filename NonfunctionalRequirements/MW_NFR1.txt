REQ-ID: MW_NFR1
Description: The product shall ensure a ticket can still be used by the customer if the return process is not completed for any reason.
Type: 12e
Rationale: Technical failures or customers choosing not to continue can interrupt a return of ticket(s) at any time. Customer complaints requiring manual reconciliation of payment and ticket(s) generates additional staff costs and potentially creates an unmanageable backlog.
Fit Criterion: On average no more than 9 tickets per 10,000 sold will require the ticket return to be completed manually.

[MW] Inserted the NFR text
[DW] Added review response: Using a failure rate as the fit criterion seems appropriate. However it may be more helpful to specify "x tickets out of y tickets RETURNED", rather than "x tickets out of y tickets SOLD".
[JK] Added review response: Should the fit criterion be expand to test what happens during an interrupted return of tickets.  For example 'If the return process is interrupted the tickets shall still be assigned to the customer in 100% of cases'
