Description: The system shall hold returned tickets until the next reallocation run
Type: Performance (safety, accuracy)
Rationale: This is intended to provide some means of analysing returned tickets before they are re-allocated and made again available to the public. Performance and reliability is crucial: No returned ticket shall be dropped, none should be duplicate (should the user klick twice, network hickups, etc).
Fit Criterion: 100 % of returned tickets shall be stored in a system store. 100% of all tickets must be re-allocated in a reallocation run. None of the returned tickets must be stored as duplicates in the system store
