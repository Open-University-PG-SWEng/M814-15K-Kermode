Description: The system shall hold returned tickets until the next reallocation run\
Type: Performance (safety, accuracy)\
Rationale: This is intended to provide some means of analysing returned tickets before they are re-allocated and made again available to the public.\
Fit Criterion: 100 % of returned tickets shall be stored in a system store. 100% of all tickets must be re-allocated in a reallocation run. None of the returned tickets must be stored as duplicates in the system\'92s store\
