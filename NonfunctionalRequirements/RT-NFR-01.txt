Comment: [RT] Added NFR RT-NFR-01 based on FR RT-FRQ-02 (24/02/16)
REQ-ID: RT-NFR-01
Description: The system will continue to perform in responsive manner for customers buying tickets when a large amount of returns are also taking place.
 Type: Performance
Rationale: Over 5 million tickets will be sold as part of the Commonwealth Games.  In order to encourage customers to buy tickets the system needs to be responsive, even when a large number of returns may be taking place.  This will encourage continued use of the system as customers will not be frustrated by slow performance.
Fit Criterion: The system must be able to process 5,000 ticket returns over a 10 minute period, whilst allowing 10,000 purchases to take place in that same period.  
Originator: Leslie Patterson
Comment: [RT] NFR to enable for performance to maintained when a high volume of returns are taking place.
Comment: [RT] Changed [Amelja] to [RT] as per module chair comment.
Comment: [Sam] Adding suggested change request to fit criterion: good.  However, when is this ‘period’ taking place?  Network and Data traffic can be different at different times of the day.  Could the product do what you suggest at 'peak' times (not forgetting to mention when is the peak time).
Comment: [MJW] I think that this is ok, but even though we do not have too many specifics, I would doubt that demand for returns would ever be as high as half of the demand for purchases.
